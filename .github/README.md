<!-- Concept -->
The Helix Project ([website](https://helix-medical.github.io)) is a Patient Management System (PMS) specially built for Osteopaths purposes. You can find some popular features like:

+ Patient management (medical history, appointments, billing, ...)
+ Appointment management (personal and professional calendar ...)
+ Billing management (invoices, export to Excel, ...)
+ Multi-user management (with different roles for the whole cabinet)

All that features are available in a single application, with a simple and intuitive interface, and **for ever** free!

## Philosophy

> Helix is 100% **free**, **open-source**, and **self-hosted**, forever.

+ **Free**: Helix is free for everyone, forever. No ads, no paywall, no premium version. We decided to make Helix free because we think that everyone should have access to a free and open-source Patient Management System.

+ **Open-source**: Helix is open-source, which means that anyone can contribute to the project. We are open to any contribution, and we will be happy to help you to contribute to the project. We believe in the power of open-source, and we want to make Helix a great project.

+ **Self-hosted**: Helix is self-hosted, which means that you host your own instance of Helix. The personal data of your patients are secure **on your cabinet** and the Helix Team or anyone cannot access to this data. We are of course GDPR compliant.

## Is Helix for me?

Helix is for you if you are an Osteopath and you want to manage your cabinet with a simple and intuitive application. Helix is especially for you if you are a student, or a young Osteopath, and you want to manage your cabinet with a free and open-source application.

Helix is also for you if you are a developer and you want to contribute to an open-source project. We are open to any contribution, and we will be happy to help you to contribute to the project. We believe in the power of open-source, and we want to make Helix a great project.
